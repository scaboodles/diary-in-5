# diary-in-5
quick diary writing app to get you in a writing flow state. Inspired by betaveros's themostdangerouswritingapp (https://github.com/betaveros/themostdangerouswritingapp)

Automatically closes and saves in hidden diary directory sorted by year/month/day.txt after 5 seconds of inactivity

Made in curses.
